# 0x18. Webstack Monitoring

## Overview
In the realm of web development and system management, monitoring plays a pivotal role in ensuring the smooth operation and optimal performance of software systems. This project, denoted as "0x18. Webstack monitoring," delves into the significance and implementation of monitoring tools within the webstack infrastructure.

Monitoring, as encapsulated by the famous adage "You cannot fix or improve what you cannot measure," is crucial in the tech industry, particularly in the era of data-ism. It enables the collection of pertinent data about software systems, facilitating insights into their behavior and performance. The project emphasizes two primary facets of monitoring:

1. **Application Monitoring**: This involves gathering data about running software to ensure it operates as intended. It encompasses tracking various metrics to gauge the health and efficiency of the application.

2. **Server Monitoring**: This entails obtaining data about virtual or physical servers to prevent overload conditions. Key areas of server monitoring include CPU usage, memory consumption, disk activity, and network traffic.

## Key Topics Explored
- **System Monitoring by Google**: Likely referencing Google's practices and tools for system monitoring, indicating industry best practices.
- **Nginx Logging and Monitoring**: Specific focus on Nginx, a popular web server software, discussing the importance of logging and monitoring within this context.
- **Need for Monitoring**: Highlighting the importance of monitoring in ensuring system stability, performance, and reliability.
- **Access Logs and Error Logs for Web Servers**: Detailing the significance of access logs, which record requests made to the web server, and error logs, which capture any encountered errors or issues.

## Conclusion
Overall, the project underscores the critical role of monitoring in maintaining the health and efficiency of software systems, encompassing both application and server aspects. Through effective monitoring practices, DevOps and SysAdmin professionals can proactively identify and address potential issues, thereby enhancing the overall reliability and performance of webstack environments.
