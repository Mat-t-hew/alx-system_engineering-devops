# What happens when you type Google.com in your browser and press enter?

## The Address Request: 
Imagine you're trying to find a friend's house. First, you need their address. Similarly, your browser asks for the address of "holbertonschool.com" from something called DNS (Domain Name System). This system helps find where websites are located on the internet.

## Checking Permissions: 
Just like your friend's house might have a gate, there's something called a firewall that checks if your browser is allowed to visit the website. It's like a security guard for the internet.

## Securing the Connection: 
If everything checks out, your browser connects to the website using a special protocol called HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure). This ensures that the connection between your browser and the website is safe and encrypted, like a secret code only you and the website can understand.

## Finding the Website: 
The DNS system helps translate the name "holbertonschool.com" into an actual internet address, kind of like translating a nickname into a real name. Once your browser knows where the website is, it sends a request to that address.

## Balancing the Load: 
Sometimes, a website can get a lot of visitors at once, like when a lot of people want to visit a popular store. A load balancer helps spread out the visitors evenly to different servers so that no one server gets overwhelmed.

## Getting the Information: 
Once your browser finds the website, it asks for all the information it needs, like pictures, text, and buttons. This information is stored on a special computer called a web server.

## Making it Work: 
The web server takes all the information it has and turns it into a language your browser can understand, like translating a book into a language you know.

## Handling the Behind-the-Scenes Stuff: 
Some websites need to do more than just show pictures and text. They might need to remember your username and password, or show you personalized information. For this, they use something called an application server, which helps manage all the fancy stuff happening behind the scenes.

## Storing Data: 
Lastly, all the information the website needs to remember, like your username or the things you've posted, is stored in a database. It's like a giant filing cabinet where the website keeps all its important information.

So, when you type "holbertonschool.com" into your browser, all these different parts work together to make sure you see the website just the way you expect it. Cool, right?
